Dreamingorawake is a react app designed to allow the user to check whether they are dreaming or awake using a set of tools that mimic dream-seeming content.<br>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## What Does It Do

The purpose of this app is not only to give users an easy way to check if they are dreaming or awake, but also to present content that looks dream-like enough to make them question if they are actually awake.

There are three tools to check and two of these the "tech" and "text" tricks, randomize between dreaming or awake each time you use them. In this way, they sometimes display the content in a way that makes it look like you are dreaming, and sometimes makes it seem like you are awake.

By quizzing the user on whether they think what they saw looked more like a dream or waking, the app helps condition users to truly ask themselves if everything they are experiencing lines up with the characteristics of a waking experience.

The text tool either displays wobbly text that retains its core meaning (awake) or it displays wobbly text that loses its meaning and transforms over time (dreaming).

The tech tool displays a light switch, which either turns the screen dark (awake) or does nothing (dreaming).

The third tool, the nose check, is a physical check that should always yield the result that you are awake (until you try it in a dream).

## Potential Upgrades

Let me know your thoughts on what we could add to the tool. I'm thinking:

- Better instructions in a tooltip-like view
- Improved nose check graphic (I drew the current one with my mouse)
- Clearer copy
